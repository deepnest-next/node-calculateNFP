# Rust Minkowski Examples

This directory contains examples of how to use the Rust Minkowski library for NFP (No-Fit Polygon) calculations.

## Running Examples

To run an example, use the following command from the project root:

```bash
cargo run --example basic_nfp
```

## Available Examples

### basic_nfp.rs

A basic example that demonstrates how to:
1. Define two polygons (with and without holes)
2. Calculate the NFP between them
3. Process the results

This example shows the fundamental usage of the library for simple polygon nesting scenarios.
